Ideal functionality:
1) Normal working carousel
2) When hovering over the pictures they should play gifs
3) Upon stopping hovering it should pause the gifs
4) Upon re-hovering it should play from where it was paused
5) It should be clickable and link to the project

Current functionality
1) Buttons don't scroll
2) This works!
